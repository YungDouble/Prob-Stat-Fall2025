Ch. 1 Probability

I. Random Experiment and Sample Space ( Section 1.1)

- Sample Space, S , is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment

- Coin Example, toss a coin once, and observe result
a.) Random Experiment - YES
b.) sample space S = { H, T}  <-- Countable

- Die Example
a.) Random exp? YES
b.) S = [1,2,3,4,5,6}  <-- Countable

- Grade Example
a.) Random Exp? YES 
b.) S = {A, B, C, D, F}  <-- Countable


- Coke Example
a.) Random Exp? 
b.) S = { w }  w - is a possible example in the sample space, w is bounded by, S = {w, 0 <= w <= 12}
- This is an uncountable sample space

- Tossing a coin twice
a.) random exp? Yes
b.) sample space also tree diagram, S = {TT, TH, HT, HH}


7.) Keep rolling dice, until you get both odd numbers
a.) Random exp? YES
b.) S = { EO, EEO, EEEO, ... }
    S = { OE, OOE, OOOE ... } different subset

8.) How about selecting 10 students from class and observe # of siblings.
a.) Random Exp? YES
b.) one element: {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5}

- Sample space is countable or uncountable
- if the set of items in sample space, is finite, then we have countable # of elements
- A sample space is a countable sample space if its set of outcomes is either finite or countable infinite

C.) Which sample spaces in B is not countable 


- if we have some interval like (a, b), or (9, 12) like the coke can
r = n/m the rational relationship
i != m/n irrational relationship is not countable
- The set of numbers in the interval from a to b is not countable
