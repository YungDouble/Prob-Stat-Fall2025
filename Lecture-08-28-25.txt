Ch. 1 Probability

I. Random Experiment and Sample Space ( Section 1.1)

- Sample Space, S , is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment

- Coin Example, toss a coin once, and observe result
a.) Random Experiment - YES
b.) sample space S = { H, T}  <-- Countable

- Die Example
a.) Random exp? YES
b.) S = [1,2,3,4,5,6}  <-- Countable

- Grade Example
a.) Random Exp? YES 
b.) S = {A, B, C, D, F}  <-- Countable


- Coke Example
a.) Random Exp? 
b.) S = { w }  w - is a possible example in the sample space, w is bounded by, S = {w, 0 <= w <= 12}
- This is an uncountable sample space

- Tossing a coin twice
a.) random exp? Yes
b.) sample space also tree diagram, S = {TT, TH, HT, HH}


7.) Keep rolling dice, until you get both odd numbers
a.) Random exp? YES
b.) S = { EO, EEO, EEEO, ... }
    S = { OE, OOE, OOOE ... } different subset
- we have inifitely many we know what follow the pattern
- as a result this is a countable sample space, 
- if you can associate counting numbers to your element, then you have a countint number associated with it, then it is countable
- likewise {0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 .... } since we can associate counting numbers, it is countable

8.) How about selecting 10 students from class and observe # of siblings.
a.) Random Exp? YES
b.) one element: {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5}

- Sample space is countable or uncountable
- if the set of items in sample space, is finite, then we have countable # of elements
- A sample space is a countable sample space if its set of outcomes is either finite or countable infinite

C.) Which sample spaces in B is not countable 


- if we have some interval like (a, b), or (9, 12) like the coke can
r = n/m the rational relationship
i != m/n irrational relationship is not countable
- The set of numbers in the interval from a to b is not countable


II.) EVENTS

A. Definitions

1.) An event is a subset of the sample space (S)  <-- why events
    - denoted A, B, C ...

-Can two outcomes occur at the same time> NO, because the experiment produces only one outcome.
Is the empty set an event? Justify, Yes, because the null or empty set is a subset of any set, including s.

2.) The complement of event A, A bar is an even containing elements of S that are not in event A.

3.) The intersection of events A and B, A intersect B, is an event or A AND B, is an event containing elements of S that are in both A and B.

4.) The union of events A and B, A UNION B, is an event containing elements of S that are in either in A or in B, or in both.
The UNION also can mean OR

5.) Events A and B are mutually exclusive (or disjoing) if
A disjoint B = empty set null

6.) A and B are exhaustive events, if A Union B = S.

7.) Exhaustive + Mututally Exclusive = Complimentary

B.) EXAMPLES

1.) Die Example, Roll a siz-sided die and observe number on top

A = ">=" = {4,5,6]

B = "even" = { 2, 4, 6 }

C = "odd" = { 1, 3, 5 }

D = "getting siz" = { 6 }

E = "getting seven" = { } = empty set


S = 

- A Bar = { 1, 2, 3 }
- B Bar = { C } 
- E Bar = S, the compliment of the emty set is the sample space

- A Interect B = { 4, 6 }
- A Union B = { 4, 5, 6}
- B union D = {  }

- Note 1 S has distinct elements
- Note 2 any event = subset of s also has distinct elements

c.) Contract relationship between B and C and that between D and C

For B and C = Complimentary
and for D and C = Mutually Exclusive


b.) Determine S = { A, B, C, D, F, } grade after semester
G = "Passing" = { A, B, C }
H = "failing" = { D, F }
K = "at most a B" = {B, C, D, F}

G Bar = H
G intersect K = {B, C}
G union K, passing but at most a B = S

c.) describe the relationship between g and H using 3 words
Complimentary, mutually, excluive, exhaustive, (when you take the union you get sample space)

3.) Absense Example
- A = "missing at least one class" = { 1, 2 ,3, ..., 30 }
-B = "missint at most 10 classes" = { 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 }

Determine

- A Bar = "none" = {0}
- A intersect B = {1,2, 3 .. 10}
- A Bar UNION B Bar = B Bar = {11, 12, 13, ..., 30}


C. De Morgans

A Union B = A bar intersect B bar means neither A nor B
A untion B = either a or B

- A bar intersect B Bar   means not both
A intersect = both A and B

Let A = Yes and B = CS

Sample Space = { s1, s2, s100 }
- Determine the number of students in the following events:  n(A) = # elements in A
- A: n(A) = 50 
- B: n(B) = 35
- A intersect B n(A interset B) = 20
- A union B: n(A union B) = 65

- A bar intersect B bar = A bar union B bar = 35
- A bar union B bar = a bar and b bar = 80


The probability that event A occurs, P(A) is a set function assigning a real number in [0,1] to event A. 
-Input: is a set, is an event

-Output: the number of functions assigned to the event, a real number between 0 and 1
